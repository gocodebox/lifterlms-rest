  title: LifterLMS REST API
  description: >-
    # Introduction

    LifterLMS (LLMS) is fully integrated with the [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/). This allows LifterLMS data to be created, read, updated, and deleted using requests in JSON format and using WordPress REST API Authentication methods and standard HTTP verbs which are understood by most HTTP clients.

    ## Public Beta

    As of LifterLMS version 3.34.0, the LifterLMS REST API is included in the LifterLMS core plugin for public evaluation and testing.

    The specification may change slightly over the next few months as we evaluate feedback and use-cases. If you are building integrations relying on the REST API please keep your eye on our changelog and let us know how things are going!

    If you're interested in contributing or discussing the REST API, please join us in [GitHub](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms-rest) and post in `#developers` on the [LifterLMS Community Slack](https://lifterlms.com/slack).

    ## Requirements

    To use the latest version of the REST API you must be using the following:

      + LifterLMS Version 3.34.0+.
      + WordPress 5.2+.
      + Pretty permalinks in `Settings -> Permalinks` so that the custom endpoints are supported. **Default permalinks will not work.**
      + An SSL certificate.

    ## Libraries and Tools

    ### Official Libraries

    LifterLMS develops and maintains official libraries for different programming languages so you can easily build around the REST API.

      + [Node/Javascript](https://github.com/gocodebox/llms-api-node)
      + PHP (coming soon)

    ### Tools

    Some useful tools to help develop and access the REST API:

      + [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) - A multi platform REST API GUI client.
      + [RESTCLient](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/) - A free Firefox add-on.
      + [Advanced REST client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo) - A free Google Chrome extension.
      + [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com/) - A free service allowing you to quickly test webhooks.

    # Authentication

    Requests to most API resources require authentication. Authentication can be preformed by providing API Credentials by using as the username and password via [HTTP Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) or through request headers.


    Requests to the REST API may only be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Requests made over HTTP will fail.

    ## Basic Authentication

    The preferred authentication method is HTTP Basic Authentication.

    To use HTTP Basic Auth, provide the Consumer Key as the username and the Consumer Secret as the password.

    ```
      curl https://example.tld/wp-json/llms/v1/courses \
        -u ck_d7W85twOWT0poKzDSAQzI7:sk_8bsMmRfjW1HgEFw5ad7BIF
    ```

    ## Header Authentication

    Alternatively, requests may be authenticated by providing the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret as the request headers `X-LLMS-CONSUMER-KEY` and `X-LLMS-CONSUMER-SECRET`.

    ```
      curl https://example.tld/wp-json/llms/v1/courses \
        -H X-LLMS-CONSUMER-KEY: ck_d7W85twOWT0poKzDSAQzI7 \
        -H X-LLMS-CONSUMER-SECRET: sk_8bsMmRfjW1HgEFw5ad7BIF
    ```

  - name: Student Progress
    description: |
      The Student Progress API allows you to create, view, update, and delete a student's progress through courses.

      A student's progress through a course is calculated by dividing the number of lessons completed by the student by the total number of lessons available in a course. It is not possible to manually update the `progress` percentage property of a course, instead you must update the status of each lesson in the course.

      When updating the status of a course or a section, the status of the lessons within that course or section will be automatically updated to match the status of the course or section. For example, when updating a course's status to `complete` a new `complete` progress record will be created/updated for each incomplete lesson in the course.

      Finally, the `progress` property of a lesson will _always_ be either `0` _or_ `100` whereas the `progress` of courses and sections will range from `0` _to_ `100`.

  - name: Webhooks
    description: |
      Webhooks can be created to notify you about LMS-related events that happen on your site.

      The Webhooks API allows you to create, view, update, and delete webhooks.

      Webhooks may additionally be managed on the LifterLMS Webhooks screen on your site's WordPress admin panel.

      ## Topics

      The `topic` is a combination of the resource (e.g. student) and event (e.g. created). Each `topic` maps to one or more hook names (e.g. `llms_user_registered`). The proper hooks are automatically added based on the `topic`.

      The following topics are available:

      + Courses
        + `course.created`
        + `course.updated`
        + `course.deleted`
        + `course.restored`
      + Sections
        + `section.created`
        + `section.updated`
        + `section.deleted`
        + `section.restored`
      + Lessons
        + `lesson.created`
        + `lesson.updated`
        + `lesson.deleted`
        + `lesson.restored`
      + Memberships
        + `membership.created`
        + `membership.updated`
        + `membership.deleted`
        + `membership.restored`
      + Students
        + `student.created`
        + `student.updated`
        + `student.deleted`
      + Student Enrollment
        + `enrollment.created`
        + `enrollment.updated`
        + `enrollment.deleted`
      + Student Progress
        + `progress.updated`
        + `progress.deleted`
      + Instructors
        + `instructor.created`
        + `instructor.updated`
        + `instructor.deleted`

      Custom topics can also be used in order to create a webhook triggered by an arbitrary WordPress hook. For a custom topic use the `action` resource with any hook as the event. For example, to create a webhook triggered by the `user_register` hook the topic would be `action.user_register`.

      ## Delivery

      Webhook payloads are delivered in the background using wp-cron and `wp_remote_post()` (HTTP POST).

      Custom headers are supplied to assist with the receipt of the webhook:

      | Header                   | Description                                        | Example             |
      | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
      | X-LLMS-Webhook-Source    | The URL of the LifterLMS website.                  | https://example.tld |
      | X-LLMS-Webhook-Topic     | The webhook `topic` property.                      | student.created     |
      | X-LLMS-Webhook-Resource  | The webhook `resource` property.                   | student             |
      | X-LLMS-Webhook-Event     | The webhook `event` property.                      | created             |
      | X-LLMS-Webhook-Signature | A base64 encoded HMAC-SHA256 hash of the payload.  |                     |
      | X-LLMS-Webhook-ID        | The unique webhook identifier (WordPress post ID). | 654                 |
      | X-LLMS-Delivery-ID       | A unique ID for the webhook delivery.              | 765                 |

      The payload is a JSON-encoded object of the API resource as if retrieved by a `GET` request.

      The payload for a custom hook will be a JSON-encoded version of the first parameter supplied by the hook.

      ## Signature Verification

      Webhooks are signed by LifterLMS and the event's unique signature is included in the `X-LLMS-Webhook-Signature` header. The signature allows you to verify that the webhook was sent by LifterLMS and not by a third party. We recommend verifying all webhooks and discarding any payloads which cannot be verified.

      The `X-LLMS-Webhook-Signature` contains a timestamp and one or more signatures. The timestamp is prefixed by `t=` and the signatures are prefixed by `v` and an integer. Currently the only valid signature scheme is `v1`.

      ```
      X-LLMS-Webhook-Signature: t=1562715579,v1=0d579d62ef442b6e2d1d522924aafed480fdaaacbe498486a94445de8b995819
      ```

      The signature is generated using a hash-based message authentication code ([HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC)) with [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2).

      To verify a webhook signature you must construct an _expected_ webhook signature which you can then compare against the webhook signature supplied with delivery.

      #### Step 1: Extract the timestamps and signatures from the header

      Split the header, using the `,` character as the separator, to get a list of elements. Then split each element, using the `=` character as the separator, to get a prefix and value pair.

      The value for the prefix `t` corresponds to the timestamp, and `v1` corresponds to the signature. You can discard all other elements.

      #### Step 2: Prepare the payload string for signing

      You achieve this by concatenating:

      + The timestamp (as a string)
      + The character `.`
      + The actual JSON payload (i.e. the request's body)

      #### Step 3: Generate the expected signature string

      Compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function. Use the endpoints signing secret as the key, and use the string from Step 2 as the message.

      #### Step 4: Compare the signatures

      Compare the signature(s) in the header to the expected signature. If a signature matches, compute the difference between the current timestamp and the received timestamp, then decide if the difference is within your tolerance. We recommend accepting a difference of no more than five minutes between the provided timestamp and the current time.
